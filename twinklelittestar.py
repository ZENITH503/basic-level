print('''For babies, songs and their actions are fun games. They’ll love hearing their favourites, especially if you sing it to them. They like to hear the voices of important people in their life.


Try doing the song through a few times. Repetition is comforting for babies. In time, your little one might be able to copy the sounds or actions.

You can make up your own actions and words if you like. Maybe use your baby’s name in the song to see if they recognise it.''')
